# VMDetect
VM detect is a go library that tries to decide whether it is running inside a virtual machine.

Malware analysts can use this if they want to check if malware can detect their virtual environment or not.

## Features
- Checks for the existence of registry keys created by VM platforms
- Checks for applications/files created by VM platforms
- Checks running processes for known VM processes
- Checks registered services on the device for known VM services
- Extendible -> All the checks that are performed, are stored in the [vmdetect_data.json](https://github.com/mohabgabber/vmdetect/blob/main/vmdetect_data.json) if you want to add new artifacts to check for, it is as simple as editing the JSON file
- Automatic -> All you have to do is run the executable, it will download the latest JSON file available, and log all findings in the current working directory

## Platform Support
VMDetect currently only supports the following platforms:
  - VirtualBox
  - VMware

## How to use
You can either use the executable found in the "Releases" tab on Github. Or use `go get` to install it and use it within your project
```bash
go get github.com/cyberhotline/vmdetect@latest
go mod tidy
```
The import it into your project, and use the `detection.IsVM()` function, which will take care of everything else
```go
package main

import "github.com/cyberhotline/vmdetect/detection"

func main() {
  detection.IsVM()
}
```
